ARDUINO BLE JDY-08 Sensor Node
==============================

CAD A
=====
WORK IN PROGRESS - This board is not tested in any way shape or form. 

CAD A released for manufacture 8 Nov 2017. 

* Low power battery operated Bluetooth LE environmental sensor node. 
* Based on an Arduino Pro Mini 3.3v, 8MHz device
* Arduino IDE compatible ATMEGA328P, but without the expansion pinouts 
* Using JDY-08 Bluetooth LE CC2541 with FET power down added to PCB for low power modes. 
* Eagle cad 7.5.0
* For use with NON-rechargable batteries eg 2 x AA or AAA 
* Reverse battery protection and safety fuse (battery input only)
* 3V Operation direct from battery, no regulator 

Derived from the Arduino Pro Mini board 3.3v 8MHz version, with BLE added, connectors removed for space and routing reasons. 

Open Source Hardware.
